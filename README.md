My life has been the poem I would have writ
But I could not both live and utter it.
*Henry David Thoreau*

First I searched the internet for any poems or words that were powerful, and in my search I decided to use the paragraph above.
So after finalizing the textual content, I started looking for some interesting and meaningful typography online. Then I found the following examples

Based on my writing, I have some ideas.

1.I want my text to be randomized (like 4) and it would be nice to be able to randomize the upper and lowercase and thickness of the text to randomize its position
What I can't understand is how to separate each letter, so I searched if there would be a function like split the letters

I really like the chaotic feeling, similar to the "But I could not both live and utter it" feeling of the poem I chose.

So I think this idea could be a good way to "visualize" the poem.
My first draft, notes and ideas

but the consloe shows nothing and seems not working

my notes and my searches, I learnt the split(), if i want the letters appeared one by one
also I learnt the toUpperCse() if I want to change the upper or lower cases of the fonts

So I looked to find out what the problem was, then I FOUND that maybe the computer was confused about my 'letter' defination 
I looked up some tutorials, asked my roommate and realized I needed to make some changes. 
I should need a shift(). My understanding is that this will help me retrieve and remove the first element with to re-add the new one

It works,But I'm not very happy with it, and I think there still has to be some thought put into the design. 
So I was wondering if I could get this to repeat a couple times within a certain amount. (like 2) I don't have any ideas, so I'll just have to copy the text a few more times
then I found I need to find a nice typeface

I ended up just playing with size to make the picture look better
But in the end I gave up on drawing on half a canvas, full canvas looks better!
